## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing any custom CSS. This approach offers great flexibility and helps in maintaining consistency across large projects.

### Core Concepts:

1.  **Utility-First:** Style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.
2.  **Responsive Design:** Easily create responsive layouts using Tailwind's screen prefix variants (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`).
3.  **Customization:** Highly customizable through its `tailwind.config.js` file.

> Tailwind empowers developers to build rapidly without leaving their HTML.

This is just a brief overview. For more in-depth guides, check out the official Tailwind CSS documentation.
