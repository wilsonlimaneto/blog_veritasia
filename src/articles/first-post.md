## Introduction to Next.js 15

Next.js continues to evolve, and version 15 brings a host of exciting updates. This version focuses heavily on optimizing build times, improving server components, and introducing new APIs for a more streamlined development workflow.

### Key Highlights:

*   **Enhanced Turbopack:** Significant improvements in build speed and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
*   **Server Actions Stability:** Server Actions are now more robust and easier to debug.
*   **New Caching Strategies:** More granular control over caching mechanisms for better performance.

```javascript
// Example of a new API in Next.js 15
export async function newApiExample() {
  // ... implementation
  return { data: "New feature output" };
}
```
