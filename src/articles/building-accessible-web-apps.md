## Why Accessibility (a11y)?

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can use the web. It's crucial for inclusivity and often a legal requirement.

### Core Principles (WCAG):

*   **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
*   **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
*   **Understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
*   **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Practical Tips for React/Next.js:

1.  **Semantic HTML:** Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons).
2.  **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance accessibility where semantic HTML is insufficient.
3.  **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
4.  **Image Alt Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all images.
5.  **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.

\`\`\`tsx
// Example of an accessible button
<button
  aria-label="Submit form"
  onClick={handleSubmit}
  className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
>
  Submit
</button>
\`\`\`

- Prioritizing accessibility benefits all users and creates a more inclusive web.
