## Understanding Advanced React Patterns

Moving beyond basic component creation, advanced React patterns help manage complexity, share logic, and improve code reusability.

### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced props or behavior.

```javascript
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(\`Component \${WrappedComponent.name} mounted.\`);
    }
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
```

### Render Props

The render props pattern involves a component with a prop whose value is a function that returns a React element and is called instead of implementing its own render logic.

### Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

> These patterns, when used appropriately, can significantly improve the architecture of your React applications.
