Next.js offers many built-in optimizations, but understanding how to leverage them is key.

### Key Optimization Techniques:

1.  **`next/image`:** Always use for image optimization (resizing, format conversion, lazy loading).
2.  **Dynamic Imports (`next/dynamic`):** Code-split components that are not needed for the initial render.
3.  **Route-based Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code by page.
4.  **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Static Site Generation (SSG):** Choose the right rendering strategy for each page.
5.  **Caching:** Implement effective caching for data and static assets.

\`\`\`tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import Image from 'next/image';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'));

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Image src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="My Image" width={500} height={300} />
      <HeavyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

> Focusing on these areas can dramatically improve your Next.js application's load times and user experience.
