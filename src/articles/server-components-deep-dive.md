## What are Server Components?

React Server Components (RSCs) allow you to write UI components that run on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and improving initial page load times.

### Key Benefits:

*   **Zero Client-Side JavaScript:** RSCs can render entirely on the server, sending only HTML to the client.
*   **Direct Data Access:** Server Components can directly access server-side data sources (databases, APIs) without needing to expose API endpoints.
*   **Improved Performance:** Reduced bundle sizes and faster rendering lead to better Core Web Vitals.

### Example

A simple Server Component:

\`\`\`tsx
// app/my-server-component/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  // Fetch data directly from a database or API
  return { message: "Data from server!" };
}

export default async function MyServerComponentPage() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <h1>{data.message}</h1>;
}
\`\`\`

> Server Components represent a significant shift in how we build web applications with React and Next.js.
